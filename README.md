- Bonjour, I'm @Count-Mendele
- I'm interested in RPG (Deltarune like) and horror (FNaF like) games
- Currently I'm (and my friend, a little) trying to make FNaF parody
- I'm currently learning C# with Unity and GDScript with Godot
- I'm looking to collaborate on optimizating scripts and gameplay
- You can find me on Discord (count_mendele)
- Pronouns: he/ they
- Fun fact: I'm neither French nor English native speaker
